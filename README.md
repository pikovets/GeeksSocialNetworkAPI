## 1. Introduction
The backend of **GeeksSocialNetwork** is designed to provide a robust and scalable architecture that supports the platform's core functionalities. Built using modern Java technologies and frameworks, the backend handles essential operations related to user management, community interactions, and content creation, ensuring a seamless experience for users.

At the heart of this architecture is the **Spring Boot** framework, which facilitates the development of RESTful APIs for various services. These services include user authentication, post management, commenting, and community features, all structured to enable efficient data handling and interaction. The backend also implements comprehensive security measures through JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication, ensuring that user data and interactions remain secure and protected.

For ease of development and integration, the backend provides an interactive API documentation interface through Swagger. This documentation allows developers to explore available endpoints, view request/response formats, and test API calls directly from the browser. The Swagger UI can be accessed at the following URL: http://localhost:3000/swagger-ui/index.html.

### 1.1 Technologies Used

**Java:** The primary programming language for developing the backend services.

**Spring Boot:** A framework for building RESTful APIs with ease, providing features like dependency injection and configuration management.

**Spring Security:** A powerful and customizable authentication and access control framework for securing the application.

**JPA (Java Persistence API):** Used for managing relational data in Java applications. This project utilizes Hibernate as the implementation for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).

**PostgreSQL:** An advanced open-source relational database management system used for data persistence.
